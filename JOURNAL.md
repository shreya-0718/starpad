Here is my journal about my journey making the _starpad_, a DIY macropad! âœ¨ðŸ’–

## Research + Schematic (2 hours)
Date: 07/03/2025
Super excited to start! PS, prior to this (like a couple weeks back) I followed the https://hackpad.hackclub.com/guide to get a feel for how to make this. 
After procrastinating for a couple weeks on various different projects and a trip to the Smokies, here I am!

I looked back over the Hackpad guide, as well as this one: https://wiki.ai03.com/books/pcb-design/page/matrices-and-duplex-matrix
before making a new project on KiCad and diving into making this thing. 

Here is the schematic:
